Project Movie Trailer :-
This provides a web page for browsing posters of my  favourite movies.
On mouse hover, it displays the storyline.
On mouse click it starts the movie trailer.
It can be extended to include other details of movies easily as the code is object oriented.

Files included :
 media.py  -          Provides the definition of movie object and function to start the trailer
 fresh_tomoatoes.py - Provides code to dynamically build html file to display the movie poster in a tile format and provides functionlity to extract trailer you tube id and start the trailer on mouse click as well as display story line on hover.
media_try.py -        Invokes the movie object and opens the webbrowser for the movie list using the functions from media.py and fresh_tomatoes.py

How to use:
Open movie page using command   'python media_try.py'
